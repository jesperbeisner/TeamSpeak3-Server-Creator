# TeamSpeak3-Server-Creator

## About
A small application to originally run 10 TeamSpeak3 servers in their own Docker containers and start or stop them with one click. My cheap 3â‚¬ server can't handle 10 containers, so I limited this to 3 at the moment.

With the help of TeamSpeak's web query api all servers have directly all necessary channels without creating them manually.

Created with Symfony 6 and PHP 8.1. Docker is needed on the server were this application will run.
